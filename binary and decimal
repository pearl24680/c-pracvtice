 Binary & Decimal Number System 
Topics Covered:
Decimal Number System: Explanation of the decimal system with examples like 10, 15, and 16.
Binary Number System: Explanation of the binary system, which uses only 0 and 1.
Conversion from Decimal to Binary:
Method 1: Divide the decimal number by 2 and store the remainder. Repeat until the number is zero.
Example: Conversion of numbers like 2 (10 in binary), 5 (101 in binary), and 10 (1010 in binary).
Importance: Understanding these conversions is crucial for later topics involving bits.
Coding: The session includes coding examples to demonstrate the conversion process.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // Include this for the pow function
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n; // Fixing "cim" to "cin"
    int ans = 0;
    int i = 0;
    
    while (n != 0) {
        int bit = n & 10;
        ans = (digit * pow(10, i)) + ans; // Correct the use of pow function and operators
        n = n / 10; // Fixing bitwise shift to integer division
        i++;
    }
    
    cout << "Answer is " << ans << endl; // Fixing "end1" to "endl"
    
    return 0;
}
